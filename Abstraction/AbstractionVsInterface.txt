#NOTES RELATED TO ABSTRACTION

Abstract Classes & Methods
1. Class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java
2. It can have abstract (method with out the body).and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
 Abstraction Classes achieves Partial Abstraction.

Interfaces on the other hand are used for 100% abstraction

Real Life Example
There is a parent class which defines Aircraft Body Construction rules
All Child classes (Different Aircraft companies) have to inherit parent class and use those methods to build their own Aircraft
But there is a method called Aircraft color which can be unique to every child class depending on their company logo
So, color method in parent class is not implemented with anybody. Instead only method is defined with out any body which we call as Abstract method
If there is any method in class which is Abstract, then the class will be treated as Abstract class
Unlike Interfaces, this Abstract Class can have methods (Concrete) which have implementation as well. So, with Abstract class only partial Abstraction is acheived.

We cannot instantiate object for Abstract class. Child classes are forced to implement Abstract methods of Parent class.

Differences between Abstract Classes & Interfaces
Interface:
1) Interface contains only abstract methods
2) Access Specifiers for methods in interface must be public
keyword
3) Variables defined must be public, static, final
4) To implement an interface we use implements
Abstract Class:
1) Abstract class can contain abstract methods, concrete methods or both
2) Except private we can have any access specifier for methods in abstract class.
3) Except private variables can have any access specifiers
