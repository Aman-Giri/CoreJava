ENCAPSULATION: 
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit 
with the help of Access modifier.

ACCESS MODIFIER: 
There are four types of Java access modifiers:

Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class.
Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. 
Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere.
