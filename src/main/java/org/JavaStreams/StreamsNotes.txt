What are Streams?
Stream API is new feature available from java 8
By using streams, we can perform various aggregate operations on the data returned from collections classes by drastically reduce the complexity of code
What is Lambda Expression?
Lambda expressions introduce the new arrow operator → into Java. It divides the lambda expressions in two parts:
The left side specifies the parameters required by the expression, which could also be empty if no parameters are required.
The right side is the lambda body which specifies the actions of the lambda expression.


The working of stream can be explained in three stages:
1. Create a stream
2. Perform intermediate operations on the initial stream to transform it into another stream and so on on further intermediate operations
3. Perform terminal operation on the final stream to get the result.
An important characteristic of intermediate operations is laziness.
When executing this code snippet, nothing is printed to the console. That is because intermediate operations will only be executed when a terminal operation is present.
