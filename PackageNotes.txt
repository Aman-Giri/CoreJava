Packages: Set of Classes and Interfaces.
java.lang: Default Package
java.io: Package for file reading
java.util: Package for collection interfaces
We can also make User defined Packages

Note: 
Class A can use class B directly by creating the object if both class A and class B 
are inside the same package. And if class A and class B are in different packages then
we have to import the package of either class A in class B or class B in class A based 
on the Object creation
