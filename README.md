STRINGBUFFER VS STRINGBUILDER

StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning its methods are thread-safe and can be safely used in a multithreaded environment. On the other hand, StringBuilder is not synchronized, which makes it faster than StringBuffer, but it is not thread-safe and should not be used in a multithreaded environment.
